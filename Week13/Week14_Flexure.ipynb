    "The creation of accommodation space over large length-scales is dominated by three processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extensional fault-controlled subsidence which is dependent on the initial thickness and\n",
    "density of the crust and lithosphere, the lithospheric geotherm, and the amount of\n",
    "uniform stretching, $\\beta$. This isostatic subsidence may occur on timescales of 10$^{5}$ yr.\n",

    "2. Thermal subsidence occurs when lithospheric thinning leads to upwelling of the asthenosphere\n",
    "and heating of the lithosphere, and these materials cool conductively as\n",
    "the lithospheric geotherm relaxes to the pre-stretching condition. Thermal subsidence\n",
    "depends critically on the amount of stretching, $\\beta$. Thermal subsidence rates decrease\n",
    "exponentially as heat flow decreases. For standard lithosphere, heat flow reaches $\\frac{1}{e}$ of its original value after $\\tau \\approx$ 50 Myr.\n",
